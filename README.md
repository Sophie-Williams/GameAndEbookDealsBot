# GameAndEbookDealsBot

This is a small project conisting of basic python scripts to find game deals and book deals with keywords such as "free".
It currently contains a basic script version, and code for a slow (although working) discord bot, and is currently in
slow development.

# Prerequisistes
1) You need python version 3.6

For 2 and 3, you might need to use the pip command line. For windows, I recommend GitBash, and for linux/unix, its most likely built in.
If it isn't working, make sure that PIP is installed to the path of your command line.

2) You need to install PRAW at,
http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html


IF YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT THE DISCORD BOT:

3) You need to install discord.py at,
https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

4) You need to get bot tokens from Discord.
